# Tailwind Documentation

_Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file._

_It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime._

## Introduction



# Getting Started


### Should I use Tailwind for my project?
In general, Tailwind is a pretty great fit for most projects. There are a few cases where you may find the framework to be less than ideal:

- WordPress sites with large amounts of third party stylesheets that include opinionated styles.

- If your site is using plugins that have opinionated markup and styles, such as: The Events Calendar, WooCommerce, etc, you may want to consider if your project has enough time/budget to account for those styles.

- If the site is already using a framework such as Bootstrap or a design system, it may be more trouble than it’s worth to include Tailwind alongside those things. Tailwind’s styles will inevitably vary or even clash with existing styles.

Overall there are very few reasons you should be looking to introduce Tailwind to an existing project alongside existing styles.

### How Tailwind Works
Tailwind uses `PostCSS` to generate a set of utility classes to be used in the project. The utilities generated by Tailwind support are responsive and include support for interaction states such as hover and focus. In the latest version, Tailwind uses a Just-in-Time (JIT) engine which compiles your CSS as you make changes in your template files.

The engine will automatically include any classes you actually use in your templates and leave out everything else while still giving you all the options to choose from up front. This allows you to rapidly build UIs while keeping performance in mind from the very beginning.

Tailwind allows you to author custom classes that group multiple utilities together to simplify the creation of components with frequently repeated styles (such as a button). Styles are applied to the custom class using `@apply`.

```
.my-button {
	@apply p-4 m-2 bg-white;
}
```

The above is the preferred way to handle styles, as opposed to bloating the DOM with multiple Tailwind classes.

Any custom classes you author that are not included inside an `@layer` rule will always be included in your CSS file’s output.

### Setting up VSCode for Tailwind

The [TailwindCSS Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=austenc.tailwind-docs#:~:text=VSCode%20Tailwind%20Docs&text=To%20use%20this%20extension%2C%20simply,That's%20it!) will automatically pick up your configuration changes and provide simple autocompletes that even show you the CSS output of the class you wish to use.

Note: this extension has been included in a `.vscode` folder in the repo - when you first launch the project, `VSCODE` will suggest installing it for a better experience.

### Initial Setup Considerations

Setting up default container styles
In many cases it can be very helpful to add default padding and centering to a container so you don’t have to add several utility classes over and over. It is often helpful to have a sensible default that you can then override in cases where you do actually need to have different padding or centering behavior. This can provide a greater degree of flexibility while reducing friction during development.

The Tailwind Official Docs has a section specifically for customizing centering and padding styles, see here for details: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container#customizing](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container#customizing).

### FAQs

#### How do I add the Gutenberg color palette automatically to the Tailwind config?
By default the toolkit will look if `theme.json` is present and if so, attempt to `import` colors from the palette you've defined in it. You can also optionally specify that you want to bring in the color palette for blocks (all or specific ones) by passing in either `true` or an array of allowed block names to the `getThemeColors()` function called in `tailwind.config.js`.

#### Why aren’t my Tailwind class outputting?
Tailwind’s JIT engine generates the styles you need for your project on-demand, however there may be some edge cases where extra configuration is required. Most often custom tailwind classes or dynamic classes need extra attention.

By default, only the classes you actually use will be included in your production CSS file. Any files covered in your “content” settings will be scanned for classes to include in the CSS file output.

If you want to have classes always included in the output, they need to be written outside of an `@layer` block or added to the safelist.

#### How do I ensure my custom class outputs in the JIT compiler?
- Make sure your `content` configuration in your `tailwind.config.js` file is correct and matches all of the right source files.
- Make sure you define the class without using `@layer`. Just write it in your CSS file like you normally would and include it in the appropriate folder (component, template, utility).
- If you define a custom class in your Tailwind configuration, that class must either appear inside your content or you must include it in the `safelist` to be included.
- Ensure your classes are defined directly (i.e. without using concatenation or variables) wherever possible so the compiler can detect them.

```
 var postTypeClass = `article--${postType}` ❌
 var postTypeClass = postType === 'article' ? 'article-post` : `article-page` ✅
```
- If you truly must use a dynamic value (common for spacing utilities) you can use the safelist to make sure those utilities are always included as appropriate

See [Safelisting Classes documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#safelisting-classes) for details.

Any styles defined inside of an `@layer` or inside the `tailwind.config.js` file will be purged if they are not found in your “content” targets (e.g. the files you specify in the content option).

#### What about classes generated from WordPress?
We've got your back. We've already included a safelist of WordPress classes in the `tailwind.config.js` so no need to worry!

#### Do I need to use any Tailwind plugins?
By default, the toolkit comes with all four official Tailwind plugins installed. In most cases you'll want to just enable all of these so you can leverage all of their functionality. Any classes from these classes that you don’t use won’t be included in your project. Here is a list of the current (at the time of writing) official plugins and how they can help you in your project:

### Typography
Adds styles for longform typography sections so you’re not forced to add classes to every element in a content area
Typically essential on sites that have any longform rich text content (which is virtually all websites).

[View the official plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#typography)
#### Forms
Can be used in two modes: default styles or opt-in only. Set in plugin settings.
- Default: Styles are applied to all form elements automatically (recommended)
- By default the form styles will always be in your CSS output since the compiler can’t tell if you’re actually using forms on the page somewhere or not. In general this is what you’d want anyway.
- Opt-in: Scopes all styles to classes (e.g. form-input, form-checkbox, etc).

[View the official plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#forms)
#### Aspect Ratio
Adds utility classes to control a fixed [aspect ratio](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/aspect-ratio/) to elements (e.g. 16:9, 4:3, etc)
Leverages the aspect-ratio property

[View the official plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#aspect-ratio)
#### Line Clamp
Adds utility classes to support the [CSS line-clamp](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/line-clamp/) property
Truncates text to a certain number of lines via styles.

See the [Tailwind Plugins page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins) for further information.

#### Tailwind comes with a default theme. Do I need to remove the default values before starting my project?

The short answer is: not necessarily. But the most important question is: why would you want to remove default options (e.g. available fonts, widths, colors, etc, to choose from) at all?

The main reason you would want to take away defaults is to prevent those things from being used in the project. This is commonly done with colors on projects where you actually have a color palette to use as you wouldn’t want to use colors that are off brand. If you have a design that includes a typography scale you should be using that one on the project, not the default from Tailwind.

That said, there are situations where some of the default Tailwind theme options can fill in gaps in your own design. For instance, if you have a color palette, but no typography scale, using Tailwind’s typography scale would be of benefit to you. Similarly, if you have a color palette that is sparse and doesn’t include things like grays, you may want to keep the gray colors but otherwise use only the client’s color palette.

The key takeaway here is that you do not need to limit the configuration for performance reasons. The JIT engine is highly optimized and automatically removes classes you aren’t using that haven’t been added to a safelist. Just think proactively about setting up other developers for success; if removing the option makes contributing to the project easier to do or learn, then it’s probably a good idea.
