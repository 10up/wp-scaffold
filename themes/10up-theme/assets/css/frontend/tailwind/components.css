/**
* Tailwind Custom Components
*
* Adds any of your own custom component classes to Tailwind’s components layer.
*
* These styles will be automatically imported at the @import url("tailwindcss/components")
* level in the main stylesheet. The specificity order of components come
* after @layer base and before @layer utilities, however Tailwind will take care
* of this for you so you don't need to worry about authoring your CSS in a
* specific order. Infact, @layer components {...} can be inserted anywhere in
* your CSS files, this file is optional for the sake or component organization.
*
* Components are useful for any more complicated classes you want to add to your
* project that you’d still like to be able to override with utility classes.
* Traditionally these would be classes like card, btn, link etc.
*
