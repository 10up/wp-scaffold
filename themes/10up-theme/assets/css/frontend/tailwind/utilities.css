/**
* Tailwind Custom Utilities
*
* Adds any of your own custom utility classes to Tailwind’s utilities layer.
*
* These styles will be automatically imported at the @import url("tailwindcss/utilities")
* level in the main stylesheet. The specificity order of utilities come last,
* so anything added in this layer while have the highest specificity in your CSS
* Note that @layer utilities {...} can be inserted anywhere in your CSS files,
* this file is optional and exists to keep utilities organized in one place.
*
* Utilities are useful when there’s a CSS feature you’d like to use in your
* project that Tailwind doesn’t include utilities for out of the box.
*
* More info: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-custom-utilities
